# Sam Gold 

I relocated from NYC to Denver to hone my Software Engineering skills. Attended the Flatiron School, where I worked primarily in React, Javascript and Ruby. Picked up Node.js and C along the way. Looking forward to continuing my education as I find my way in the tech sphere. My propensity for learning is vast.

I used to work in television production, and pivoting to software development has helped me scratch a problem solving itch that my former career just did not satisfy. 

Interests outside of engineering include golf, music, basketball, skiing, reading, and watching films. Happy to connect with any like-minded individuals.
